#' from the Commission facility in Hanford, Washington. One of the major safety
#' problems encountered there has been the storage of radioactive wastes. Over
#' the years, significant quantities of these substances - including strontium
#' 90 and cesium 137 - have leaked from their open-pit storage areas into the
#' nearby Columbia River, which flows along the Washington-Oregon border, and
#' eventually empties into the Pacific Ocean.
#'
#' To measure the health consequences of this contamination, an index of
#' exposure was calculated for each of the nine Oregon counties having frontage
#' on either the Columbia River or the Pacific Ocean. This particular index was
#' based on several factors, including the county's stream distance from
#' Hanford and the average distance of its population from any water frontage.
#' As a covariate, the cancer mortality rate was determined for each of these
#' same counties.
#' The data give the index of exposure and the cancer mortality rate during
#' 1959-1964 for the nine Oregon counties affected. Higher index values
#' represent higher levels of contamination.

#' Age estimation by root dentine translucency
#'
#' Root dentine translucency is, in humans, an age related physiological
#' feature. In the dentine of teeth in adult humans the
#' tubecular microstructures fill with a highly crystalline substance making
#' them become nearly invisible when looked at in normal light. This process
#' starts from the apical foramen in early adulthood, and progresses up the
#' tooth into advanced old age. Solheim (Lucy et al., 1996) collected data
#' on age, root dentine translucency for 71 maxillary second incisors from a
#' Norweigian population. The sex of each individual was also noted.

#' Does insulation make a difference?
#'
#' This data arose from an experiment conducted by David
#' to testing the insulation of the ground floor bedroom
#' of his house--The Spinney. The idea was that the better the insulation
#' the slower the rate cooling, so for some exponential model
#' y(t) = y(0) exp(-lambda t) - the value of lambda should go down
#' for a better insulated room
#
#' In the experiment, David ran two extension cords into the room
#' through a service port to power two electric heaters and a fan.
#' He then sealed up the room by shutting windows and door. The
#' heaters were left to heat up the room as much as they could. This
#' happened to be about 24.6 C. He then turned the heaters and fan off
#' and the recorded the rate of cooling by observing a temperture probe
#' from outside the room for about two hours.
#
#' Standard theory says that the rate of cooling is proportional to
#' the temperature differential between the indoor and outdoor temperatures.
#' To control for this days were selected which had approximately the
#' same external temperatures. The room has walls which are external and
#' internal. It was assumed that the outside and internal house (no heating)
#' had reached an equilibrium so that we only need to know the outside room,
#' but inside house temperature rather than both

#' Hedgehog survival
#'
#' The Bunnell Index (or BI) is a measurement of how tightly the hedgehog are
#' curled into a ball. One measurement is taken round the middle of the animal
#' to cross at the point where the nose ends ("A," latitudinal circumference).
#' The other measurement, using a second tape measure already secured underneath
#' the animal, is taken round the hedgehog from head to tail ("B," longitudinal
#' circumference). Care must be taken with both measurements to ensure that the
#' ends of the tape measure meet easily without altering the shape/positioning
#' of the hedgehog. When obtaining measurement A, the positioning of the tape
#' measure is crucial; a measurement taken lower down toward the tail can result
#' in a lower (inaccurate) reading. Repeatedly measuring many hedgehogs over
#' several consecutive days demonstrated consistent BI values and hence the
#' reliability of the method. A is divided by B to give a value for the BI. It
#' is important to determine the BI value to two decimal places (i.e., a value
#' of 0.794, becomes 0.79, while a value of 0.805 becomes 0.81).
