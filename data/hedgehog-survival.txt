# data from Bunnell, T. The Assessment of British Hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) Casualties on Arrival and Determination of Optimum Release Weights Using a New Index - The BI - modestly called the Bunnell Index is the hedgehogs balled. One measurement is taken round the middle of the animal to cross at the point where the nose ends (“A,” latitudinal circumference). The other measurement, using a second tape measure already secured underneath the animal, is taken round the hedgehog from head to tail (“B,” longitudinal circumference). Care must be taken with both measurements to ensure that the ends of the tape measure meet easily without altering the shape/positioning of the hedgehog. When obtaining measurement A, the positioning of the tape measure is crucial; a measurement taken lower down toward the tail can result in a lower (inaccurate) reading. Repeatedly measuring many hedgehogs over several consecutive days demonstrated consistent BI values and hence the reliability of the method. A is divided by B to give a value for the BI. It is important to determine the BI value to two decimal places (i.e., a value of 0.794, becomes 0.79, while a value of 0.805 becomes 0.81).
