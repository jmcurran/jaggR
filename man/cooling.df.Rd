\description{
This data arose from an experiment conducted by David
to testing the insulation of the ground floor bedroom
of his house--The Spinney. The idea was that the better the insulation
the slower the rate cooling, so for some exponential model
y(t) = y(0) exp(-lambda t) - the value of lambda should go down
for a better insulated room
In the experiment, David ran two extension cords into the room
through a service port to power two electric heaters and a fan.
He then sealed up the room by shutting windows and door. The
heaters were left to heat up the room as much as they could. This
happened to be about 24.6 C. He then turned the heaters and fan off
and the recorded the rate of cooling by observing a temperture probe
from outside the room for about two hours.
Standard theory says that the rate of cooling is proportional to
the temperature differential between the indoor and outdoor temperatures.
To control for this days were selected which had approximately the
same external temperatures. The room has walls which are external and
internal. It was assumed that the outside and internal house (no heating)
had reached an equilibrium so that we only need to know the outside room,
but inside house temperature rather than both
